                        Nathaniel Huenemeyer, the oldest of four siblings, came from a small town in Arizona. Although born in California, his time in Arizona helped shape who he is today. The only entertainment offered in Arizona was gaming, watching shows, or skating; the local skatepark acted as the go-to hang-out spot, where he gained his love for skating. Although he is now in his late twenties, he still appreciates skating and the skating culture. Whenever Nathaniel, often referred to as Nathan, finds himself liking something or being involved in a task, he will usually be fully immersed in it; this goes on to his fixations of things he is into, such as technology, creating cocktails, and learning. Learning is something that never stops for Nathan as he is constantly working on trying to learn something new, all to expand his knowledge and acquire wealth. Nathan’s true ambitions lie in his desire to keep his family and himself living long and happy lives. No one has compared Nathan's care and love for those around him. Always cherishing his friends and family, he dedicates his abilities to working long hours and strives to do the best in his job to help provide for those around him. Regarding his love for reaching beyond, Nathan embraces the limitless future and endless space of the universe that surrounds us, partly because of how memorizing it is but also for its wealth of potential. When a break is in place from his work, Nathan can often be found at the beach or at home, cooking a great meal, gaming, or watching anime. Anime has been a big part of Nathan’s life, and he has attended the Anime Expo every year since 2018.  Going back to immersion, anime has consistently awarded the feeling of being in a different world, which goes closely to his enjoyment of gaming. Identifying with the characters and embracing their funky worlds is the most fun for Nathan. 

Many people hold a big heart, and Nathan is one of them. Not only does he have a big heart for his family, but he also loves animals and excursions that allow him to view animals. There was even a point in his life when he considered the Coast Guard so he could be on the water and enjoy examining the animals while helping them.  Nathan’s favorite animal is the Orca (killer whale), which boasts the most intelligent yet mysterious animal; he hopes he can see them one day in their natural habitat. The best way to view the orca in its natural habitat would be to visit it where it resides, mostly in cold waters, requiring traveling. Amongst his goals of generating wealth, he also wants to travel. Circling back to immersion, being able to travel has been something Nathan has always longed for, and most importantly, visiting Thailand, as he has roots there. He takes short excursions to local nature and national parks as small accomplishments toward his goal. His efforts of working hard will undoubtedly gain him access to what he desires most and create a prosperous future as he continues to grow.
